  introduction: "This website is built on React Hooks and should be used to see examples of what I'm offering as my most valuable skills. I can also write Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I also have old training in Ruby/Ruby on Rails, Angular 1x, and smaller libraries and frameworks. I have many years of technical troubleshooting, and am often 'the cool guy' in the office, and 'one of the most productive and hardest workers I've met.' (As quoted from a previous manager.) I pick things up very quickly and have studied the human condition, happiness and the self to great lengths, and have much to offer in effective neuroscientifically proven, backed by cross academic behavioral studies and leading intellectuals in the field of psychology: Philosophy practices that brings perspectives, clearity and functionality to an otherwise desperate and chaotic world such as, 'You cannot learn what you think you already know.' -Epictetus. This one ancient and humbling quote allows me to absorb much more information than many. I've also studied in great depth conflict resolution practices (non-violent communication 15yr), which have brought about a great capacity to lead. I'm often put in charge of small groups given the more difficult tasks and often come out successful beyond expectations. And although my coding skills are rusty, if you 'hire Justin Pettit, you wont regret it.'"
